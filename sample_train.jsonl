{"text": "<s>[INST] What is fail-to-block in SteelHead and how does it work?\n[/INST] \n\nFail-to-block is a feature in SteelHead that allows the SteelHead LAN and WAN ports to serve as an Ethernet crossover cable. In fail-to-block mode, SteelHeads cannot view or accelerate traffic. Instead, all traffic is passed through the SteelHead unaccelerated. Fail-to-block is the default setting for SteelHeads. When fail-to-block is enabled, a failed SteelHead blocks traffic along its path, forcing traffic to be rerouted onto other paths (where the remaining SteelHeads are deployed). Fail-to-wire is another feature that allows the SteelHead LAN and WAN ports to serve as an Ethernet crossover cable. In fail-to-wire mode, SteelHeads cannot view or accelerate traffic. Instead, all traffic is passed through the SteelHead unaccelerated. Fail-to-wire is enabled when a SteelHead transitions to fail-to-wire or fail-to-block mode.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the formula for calculating LAN-side throughput needed for data protection?\n[/INST] \n\nThe formula for calculating LAN-side throughput needed for data protection is:\n\nLAN-side Throughput = Total amount of changed data / Time window for replication or backup job\n\nThis formula establishes whether the data protection objectives can be met by determining the speed of data going in and out of the systems on the LAN. The WAN-side throughput and level of data reduction represent the level of acceleration.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How do I configure adaptive data streamlining settings in the Management Console for optimal data protection deployment?\n[/INST] \n\nAdaptive data streamlining settings can be configured in the Management Console under Optimization > Data Replication > Performance page. These settings allow you to fine-tune the data streamlining capabilities and achieve the right balance between optimal bandwidth reduction and optimal throughput.\n\nThe adaptive data streamlining settings include different options such as default SDR/Classic Data Streamlining, Adaptive Data Streamlining, and Adaptive Compression. Each setting has its own benefits, and you can choose the one that best suits your needs.\n\nTo configure adaptive data streamlining, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to the Management Console using your administrator credentials.\n2. Navigate to Optimization > Data Replication > Performance page.\n3. Select Adaptive Data Streamlining from the list of settings.\n4. Configure the settings as per your requirements. For example, you can choose the compression level, enable multicore balancing, and adjust the maximum compression ratio.\n5. Save your changes and test the configuration to ensure that it meets your performance targets.\n\nIt's important to note that the performance of adaptive data streamlining settings depends on various factors such as the amount of new incremental data added daily or hourly, the network bandwidth, and the system resources available. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor the performance regularly and make adjustments as necessary to ensure optimal data protection deployment.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What is out-of-path deployment in SteelHead WAN acceleration?\n[/INST] \n\nOut-of-path deployment is a method of deploying a SteelHead WAN accelerator where the primary interface is not connected to a device that can perform DHCP. This type of deployment is used when there is a need for rapid deployment of a SteelHead in a site with complex or numerous connections to the WAN. In an out-of-path deployment, only a SteelHead primary interface is required to connect to the network, and the SteelHead can be connected anywhere in the LAN. An out-of-path SteelHead deployment does not have a redirecting device, and fixed-target in-path rules must be configured for the client-side SteelHead. The fixed-target in-path rules point to the primary IP address of the out-of-path SteelHead. The remote SteelHead must be deployed either in a physical or virtual in-path mode.</s>"}

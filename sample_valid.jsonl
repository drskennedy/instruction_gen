{"text": "<s>[INST] What is the difference between in-path and out-of-path in SteelHead?\n[/INST] \n\nIn-path refers to a deployment where the SteelHead is located between the client and server, allowing for direct communication between them. This allows for faster communication and can improve performance. Out-of-path, on the other hand, refers to a deployment where the SteelHead is not located between the client and server, but rather acts as a proxy between them. This can be useful in situations where physical or virtual in-path configurations are not possible, but it can also introduce additional latency and complexity.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] What happens during the 40- to 45-second delay before the client-side SteelHead declares a peer unavailable?\n[/INST]  During this delay, any incoming new connections are passed through the network unaccelerated.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does the client-side SteelHead handle connections when both the primary and backup SteelHeads become unreachable?\n[/INST] \n\nWhen both the primary and backup SteelHeads become unreachable, the client-side SteelHead tries to connect to both appliances every 30 seconds. Any new connections are passed through the network unaccelerated.</s>"}
